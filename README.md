# dotfiles

Ideas:
  - Script that auto-copies `~/` files with the same name as dotfiles here to this repository.
  - `scripts/` folder. Including a script that initializes `.vim/` directory with pathogen.
  - A script that leads me through generating an ssh key and ends with printing out the id_rsa.pub, and posting a link to ssh key adding [page](https://github.com/settings/keys). 
  - A private submodule with secret keys.
